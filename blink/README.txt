This is a sad readme that really only exists because I was supposed to turn it in and realized I hadn't.  

Basically, follow the bootloader readme to load the blink program onto the board.  
When you press one button, it will start blinking the LED with the built in LED.  
When you press the other button, it will override the first button and start making the LEDs chase each other.
